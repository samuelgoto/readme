# hello world!

This is an experimental repository that I'm using to test the github API. A lot of changes here (to this file and the issues) are going to be made programatically!!

I love blogging but I always felt like it was too much of a one-way conversation rather than something as collaborative as a google doc ... Commenting widgets are cool, but they far from something that really spurs the right discussions.

For one, they are typically placed at the bottom of the page. That creates two problems:

1. when you are reading an article for the first time, you are not running into other people's comments.
2. when you are commenting, you are commenting on the document as a whole, which makes your point a lot less effective.

Additionally, comments on blogs are fairly reactive, compared to google docs, in that you can make suggestions directly in comments, but not directly in the document itself. 

Both of these put the reader into the backseat and make blogs a lot more like a one-way conversation.
