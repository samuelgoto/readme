# hello world!

## headers are awesome too!!

This is pretty awesome! You can have the basic formatting things like **bold** and *italics* and ~~strikethrough~~! [links](foo.md) render nicely too!

* lists work 
* as you'd think

As well as numbered lists!

1. numbered
2. lists

Code blocks for most programming languages work, like javascript:

```javascript
let a = document.write("awesome!");
```

Or HTML:

```html
<html>
  <link rel="next" href="https://foo.bar">
</html>
```

Block quotes are cool too:

> hello world
> this looks pretty awesome!
>> hello world
>>> foobar
> hello world
> this looks pretty awesome!

Tables are fairly easy to use too:

| foo | bar |
| ------- | ------- |
| a cell   | another cell  |
| another row|  lots of good stuff!  |
