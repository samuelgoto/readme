# hello world!

This looks so neat!! This is starting to look more like code that kinda of works!!!

Pretty neat heh?!

Will things like lists work?

* lets see
* yep they kinda of do!!
* the **highlighting**  is still a bit off
* but not by much!!

Would things like ~~strikethrough~~ work? Yep, neat!! What about *italics*!! They do!!! So neat!!!

What about those checkboxes lists?

* [ ] will this look like a checkbox?
* [x] possibly?

Yep, that seems to look nice!!! Ha, interesting, it seems like a bit of weird formatting with the checkboxes there!
