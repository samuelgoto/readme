# hello world!

This is an experiment in web development!!

### headers are awesome too!!

This is pretty awesome! You can have the basic formatting things like **bold** and *italics* and ~~strikethrough~~! [links](another-link.md) render nicely too!

* lists work 
* as you'd think

As well as numbered lists!

1. numbered
2. lists

Code blocks for most programming languages work, like javascript:

```javascript
// syntax highlighting!!!
let a = document.write("awesome!");
```

Or HTML:

```html
<html>
  <link rel="next" href="https://foo.bar">
</html>
```

Block quotes are cool too (although rendering is still a bit off):

> hello world
> this looks pretty awesome!
>> hello world
>>> foobar
> hello world
> this looks pretty awesome!

Tables are fairly easy to use too:

| a title | another title |
| ------- | ------- |
| a cell   | another cell  |
| another row|  lots of good stuff!  |
| this is pretty awesome|  ah tables are so much easier now!  |

That's it! What else is missing?

Having the highlight for insertions make them look really cool!!

## Known Issues

* inserting a new value to a link reference seems to make the rendering off.
* the WebRTC transport for the YJS CFDS seems to be off.
* tables still seem to be rendering poorly
* inserting by coyping/pasting doesn't seem to be taken as inserting
* can't edit files other than the README
* can't edit private files
