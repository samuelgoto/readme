# hello world!

This is an experimental repository that I'm using to test the github API. A lot of changes here (to this file and the issues) are going to be made programatically!!

* [ ] will this look like a checkbox?
* [x] possibly?

I love blogging but I always felt like it was too much of a one-way conversation rather than something as collaborative as a google doc ...

This is pretty neat!
